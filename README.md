# Blitz and Deceive Launcher for League of Legends
Do you like to appear offline to your friends and have Blitz autofill your spells and runes? Do you disable Blitz and League to start when you boot your computer? Then this is helpful to you!

Must have League of Legends already installed. Only for Windows.

# Instructions
1. Download [the League of Legends w Deceive and Blitz.bat](https://github.com/IDK-Productions-CODEzzz/Blitz-and-Deceive-Launcher-for-League-of-Legends/blob/main/League%20of%20Legends%20w%20Deceive%20and%20Blitz.bat) file, and place it into its own user directory. Recommended "%userprofile%\Documents\League of Legends\Custom Launcher".
2. Right click, and "Send to Desktop (create shortcut)".
3. Double click on the newly created shortcut on your Desktop; feel free to rename it and give it a new icon. Note you can use other .exe files' icons - I recommend the typical League of Legends icon found at "C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\Game\League of Legends.exe".

# Quirks
- The file does not like to be renamed. It will ensure its name is the same every launch.
- The file will delete everything that isn't itself or "Deceive.exe" in its directory.
- If Deceive and / or Blitz are not installed, the file will download and install them.
